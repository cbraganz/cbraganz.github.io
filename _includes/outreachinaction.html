                    25th March - Outreach with FUTURES x Young Bristol (The Youth Club on Wheels)

                Young Bristol's 'The Youth Club on Wheels' works with young people aged 8-19 in hard-to-reach areas of the city and rural areas where there is no youth provision, delivering 
                activities, programmes and providing a safe place to talk with trained youth workers. A soft robotics workshop was run in partnership with the University of Bristol's 
                FUTURES scheme whose mission is reaching less advantaged, more diverse audiences, and encouraging them to have a voice in conversations around emerging technologies.
