                    <h4>25th March 2025 - Outreach with FUTURES x Young Bristol</h4> 

                <p>Young Bristol's 'The Youth Club on Wheels' works with young people aged 8-19 in hard-to-reach areas of the city and rural areas where there is no youth provision, delivering 
                activities, programmes and providing a safe place to talk with trained youth workers. A soft robotics workshop was run in partnership with the University of Bristol's 
                FUTURES scheme whose mission is reaching less advantaged, more diverse audiences, and encouraging them to have a voice in conversations around emerging technologies. </p>

                Location: Speedwell, Bristol<br>
                Participants: Ages 8â€“12<br>
                Duration: 2 hours </p>

                <p>
                    Location: Whitchurch, Bristol<br>
                    Participants: Ages 13-19<br>
                    Duration: 2 hours

                    At the start of the session, the young audience were asked 'What do you imagine when you think of a robot?' Their responses are below:

                The students were the introduced to soft robotics and together, we questioned and discussed the benefits and drawbacks. Students were then given silicone grippers to pick up wooden blocks and place them in a bag - like an arcade claw-gripper game.

                We then spoke about issues on sustainability. Rice paper actuators were demonstrated and the students were then allowed to make their own! It was messy and a very tactile experience 
                that the students got very involved in - trying different constraints to get different movements.

                <p>Shea Stew, the Youth Club on Wheels Lead for Young Bristol, said: "We had a great session delivering soft robotics with the University of Bristol. The context of soft robotics really got the group thinking about textures and feeling. A great piece of work proving that academia can work with children and youth well in bite size chunks. This collaboration was brilliant and ultimately I look forward to more of it." </p>
