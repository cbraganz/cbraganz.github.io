                    <h4>25th March 2025 - Outreach with FUTURES x Young Bristol</h4> 

                <p>Young Bristol's 'The Youth Club on Wheels' works with young people aged 8-19 in hard-to-reach areas of the city and rural areas where there is no youth provision, delivering 
                activities, programmes and providing a safe place to talk with trained youth workers. A soft robotics workshop was run in partnership with the University of Bristol's 
                FUTURES scheme whose mission is reaching less advantaged, more diverse audiences, and encouraging them to have a voice in conversations around emerging technologies. </p>

                <p>Shea Stew, the Youth Club on Wheels Lead for Young Bristol, said: "We had a great session delivering soft robotics with the University of Bristol. The context of soft robotics really got the group thinking about textures and feeling. A great piece of work proving that academia can work with children and youth well in bite size chunks. This collaboration was brilliant and ultimately I look forward to more of it." </p>
