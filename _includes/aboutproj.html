                <p>
                    This website offers free outreach resources to teach soft robotics using rice paper—a rapid, low-cost, and eco-friendly fabrication method.

Traditional prototyping often relies on silicone elastomers, which pose environmental challenges due to their use of non-renewable materials, energy-intensive manufacturing, and disposal issues.

Rice paper presents a sustainable alternative, ideal for short-term applications like outreach and education. Here, you'll find:

Guidance on how to fabricate soft actuators using rice paper

Information on its benefits and end-of-life compostability

Ready-to-use outreach resources, including workshop slides and materials lists

Made from natural, plant-based ingredients, these materials offer a renewable, biodegradable option compared to synthetic silicones—helping reduce waste and environmental impact while making robotics accessible and fun.
