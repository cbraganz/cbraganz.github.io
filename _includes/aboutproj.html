                <p>This website provides free outreach resources for teaching the public about Soft Robotics via Rice Paper rapid fabrication. 
                Current methods of iterative design and prototyping involve silicone elastomers which causes environmental concern due to their reliance 
                on non-renewable resources, energy-intensive production processes and waste management issues. 
                The website provides information on why Rice Paper is a suitable material for prototyping and short-term uses like outreach, how to use it for
                fabrication of soft actuators, and the sustainable end of life disposal. Resources to hold your own outreach sessions are also provided.
